# Cambridge CAD

This is a program made with ReactJS to visualize data. The data used is https://data.cambridgema.gov/resource/nt6q-kmgy.json which contains data about dispatches made through the CAD software dispatchers have made.

---
## Data visualized
- The group of the dispatch that was made. For example Assult, Fire Alarm.
- The primary department that was dispatched.
- The neighbourhood that the dispatch was made to.
- The day the dispatch was made.

All the visualization was done with the react-chartjs-2 package available https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-chartjs-2
